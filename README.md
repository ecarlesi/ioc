# IOC identified by Matrix

This repository collects some of the indicators identified within kits detected by the [Matrix project](https://matrixproject.info/). 

For now the extraction of indicators is manual, so, in my spare time, I dedicate myself to updating these files to share useful information to the community. 

If you want to contribute, of course, you are welcome.

The kits listed are all available in the Matrix storage. If you are a researcher and need any of these kits for analysis you can write to me and I will send you the instructions to download it.
